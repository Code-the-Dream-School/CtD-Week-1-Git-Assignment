Week 1 Assignment

Welcome. Assuming you are reading this you are on the right track and on your way to your first successful assignment. To complete it, please meet the following requirements.

Create issues on the link below on the parent repo if you are stuck and want to talk about it. You can paste code, tag people and refer to other issues there. Please use it! It will be helpful for mentors and future students to see where common problems are. Link here: https://github.com/Code-the-Dream-School/web-basics-1-week-1/issues

1. Add a page title with an H1 tag inside of the body of the index.html page.
2. Create a paragraph/p tag and write a message saying what you are most excited about learning at Code the Dream.
3. Go back and wrap/enclose your H1 tag and your paragrah tag in a div tag with a class called "content-container".
4. Add all of your changes you made from your terminal based on what you learned in the 'intro to git' class.
5. Commit your changes and write a commit message explaining what changes you made.
6. Push your changes back to your remote branch so that we can see them. 


## Additonal Instructions on how to clone/download a repo and get started. 
You will click on the Clone or download button, and then on the clipboard icon to copy the url to the clipboard.

Then open a terminal window (or Git Bash window if on Windows). Do:

cd ~
mkdir lessons
cd lessons (this is a folder where you will be keeping all of your code you write for the class)
git clone https://github.com/Code-the-Dream-School/web-basics-1-week-1-johnsmith.git
cd web-basics-1-week-1-johnsmith.git (but replace johnsmit with your git user name, you also should be able to hit tab if you begin typing the begininning of your repository name and it will autocomplete the rest

At this point the repository has been downloaded on your computer in your lessons folder. You should now be able to open the repository by navigating to it inside of your favorite code editor and opening it. Or by navigating to it in your explorer/finder and opening your code editor. 

git checkout -b lesson1
This will create a git branch for your repository called lesson1. Back on github, you will see displayed the instructions for this lesson, which involves editing an HTML file. Make the HTML changes required using your editor and save the file. Try the changes out by opening the HTML file in your web browser. Then close the file in your editor. Do the following:

git status
git add -A
git status
git commit -m "Updated html file"
git status
git checkout master
git merge lesson1
git push
The git push will require that you enter your github ID and password. It will push your revised code back to github. Additional information on git commands is available in a Treehouse class that is part of the first weekâ€™s lesson.
